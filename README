firewall-controller.py:

requires: 	- scapy

		- thrift




Configuration arguments added - use -h to see usage

If no arguments are provided it will use default values that works with test packets.


Download and Build Thrift to use Controller.

Run the following commands after installing thrift:
thrift --gen py /opt/nfp_pif/thrift/sdk6_rte.thrift
cp -a gen-py/. /opt/nfp_pif/thrift/client/
cd lib/py
python setup.py install

Copy firewall-controller.py to /opt/nfp_pif/thrift/client on host containing the NFP after installing the RTE and installing thrift.



test_packets:

1. Initially packets sent by both ./sendIn.sh and ./sendIn_to_port3.sh should be dropped.

2. Running ./sendOut.sh should send first packet to controller. Controller should add new rules and send packet back.

3. Controller packet should hit nat_int_ext_hit_1025_controller and forward to external port

4. Now ./sendOut.sh and ./sendIn.sh should hit nat_int_ext_hit and nat_ext_int_hit respectively and forward to each other. 

5. At this stage ./sendIn_to_port3.sh should still drop.

6. After running ./sendOut_port3.sh, the same should happen as in 2,3 and 4.

7. Any other packets sent to external port should still drop.
